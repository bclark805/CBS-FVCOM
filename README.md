Coastal Beaufort Sea version of the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model

This code is used to simulate the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) with landfast ice and sea ice specifically for the Coastal Beaufort Sea. The original and most up-to-date version of the FVCOM code base can be found at

https://github.com/FVCOM-GitHub/FVCOM

This specific version of the FVCOM code was modified to support research in the Great Lakes, namely with the helpful inclusion of the landfast ice parameterizations.

Thank you to Dr. Fujisake-Manome for sharing the code.
